# SFA3D
SFA3D is a cloud point object detection algorithm. This project is a Tensorflow2 port of [SFA3D](https://github.com/maudzung/SFA3D).

## prepare dataset
the model is trained on [3D KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark=3d).
download the following files 

- Velodyne point clouds (29 GB)
- Training labels of object data set (5 MB)
- Camera calibration matrices of object data set (16 MB)
- Left color images of object data set (12 GB)

put the four files under directory kitti and unzip them.
